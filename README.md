# Data-cleaning

**Data cleaning**
**1.	Load the Dataset:**
○	Start by loading the dataset into a suitable data structure, such as a Pandas DataFrame, and get an initial sense of the data by printing the first few rows.

**2.	Handling Missing Values:**
○	Identify columns with missing values.
○	Decide how to handle these missing values: remove rows, impute missing values, or replace with a default value.

**3.	Data Type Conversion:**
○	Check the data types of all columns and convert them to appropriate types (e.g., convert string dates to datetime objects, or strings that are actually numbers to numeric types).

**4.	Remove Duplicates:**
○	Check for and remove duplicate rows if necessary.

**5.	Outlier Detection and Treatment:**
○	Use statistical methods to identify outliers in the dataset.
○	Decide on the approach for handling outliers (e.g., removing them, capping them, etc.)

**6.	Normalization and Standardization:**
○	Decide if the numerical data needs to be normalized or standardized, based on the analysis you plan to do next.

**7.	Categorical Data Handling:**
○	Identify categorical data and decide how to handle them (e.g., One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding).

**8.	Text Data Cleaning (if applicable):**
○	If the dataset contains text data, clean it by removing unnecessary white spaces, correcting typos, and standardizing text (e.g., lowercasing).


**Data Exploration:**
**1.	Summary Statistics:**
○	Generate summary statistics for the dataset to get a sense of the distribution of data in numeric columns (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
2.	Univariate Analysis:
○	Analyze single variables through histograms, box plots, and frequency counts for categorical variables.
