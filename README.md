## Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains a project focused on data cleaning techniques applied to a dataset. The main goal was to ensure that the data was clean, consistent, and ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

**Project Overview**

**Problem Statement**

Data often comes with various issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, or irrelevant information. These issues can lead to inaccurate analysis or model predictions if not properly addressed. In this project, I aimed to clean and preprocess the dataset to eliminate these issues.

**Solution**

To tackle these data quality issues, I performed the following steps:

1. **Identifying Missing Values:** I identified and handled missing values using different strategies like imputation, or removing irrelevant rows/columns, depending on the context.

2. **Handling Inconsistencies:** I checked for inconsistencies in categorical values, ensuring that data entries were standardized (e.g., 'Yes' vs. 'yes' vs. 'YES' were unified).

3. **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Outliers were detected and either corrected or removed to avoid skewing the analysis results.

4. **Data Transformation:** Various transformations were applied to make the data suitable for analysis, such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating new derived columns where necessary.

Tools Used

**Python:** The primary language used for data cleaning and manipulation.

**Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.

**NumPy:** For numerical computations and handling missing data.

**Jupyter Notebook:** To document the process and showcase the steps clearly.


**Files in the Repository**

Data_Cleaning.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook where the data cleaning process is documented.

dataset.csv: The original dataset that was cleaned.

**How to Use**

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/NishaChandila/Data-cleaning.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook (Data_Cleaning.ipynb) to follow along with the data cleaning process.
Run the cells in the notebook to see the data cleaning steps in action.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates the importance of data cleaning in the data analysis pipeline. By carefully handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers, the dataset was transformed into a clean and reliable source of information, ready for further analysis or model training.
